                                    In Level 5, we would focus on writing reports. A report is a document that presents
                                    information in an organized format for a specific audience and purpose. In modern
                                    business scenario, reports play a major role in the progress of business. Reports
                                    are the backbone to the thinking process of the establishment, and they are
                                    responsible, to a great extent, in evolving an efficient or inefficient work
                                    environment.

                                <p>
                                    A typical report would include the following sections in it Title, Introduction,
                                    Discussion or Body & Conclusion
                                </p>

                                <p><b>Improvements to Main Dormitory</b></p>

                                <p><b> <u> Introduction</u></b></p>  
                             <p>   This report aims to describe problems in the Main Dormitory of Residence and discuss
                                 possible maintenance work to solve them. The two biggest issues were discussed at a
                                 meeting on 12th May, which was attended by 165 of the 250 students who live in the
                                building.</p>
                                <p><b> <u> Issue 1: temperature in rooms</u></b></p>  
                              <p> A number of students complained that the second-floor bedrooms are too hot. Concerns
                                  were raised about lack of sleep and the students finding it hard to study in their
                                  rooms. Air conditioning was suggested as a possible solution. </p> 
                              <p>  However, there is no budget left for installing air conditioning in this academic year.
                                  Also, installation can only be carried out during holidays as students cannot be present
                                in the building while the work takes place.</p>
                                <p><b> <u> Issue 2: Improving wheelchair access to Cafeteria </u></b></p> 
                               <p> It was noted that wheelchair users can only access the cafeteria from the back and not
                                   the front entrance nearer the lifts. This makes access to the cafeteria difficult for
                                   wheelchair users. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general
                                   by installing ramps in key areas and work can take place during term time with no issues
                                   for staff or students. </p>
                                   <p> <b> <u> Conclusion and recommendations </u></b></p> 
                                   <p> Taking the factors mentioned into account, August would be the best time for the
                                       installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying
                                fans to each second-floor room so students can sleep and study comfortably. </p>
                                <p>  The front of the cafeteria is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair
                                ramp. This work can take place immediately and should be a priority.</p>
