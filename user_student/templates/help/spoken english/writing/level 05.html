                                    days of hand-written mails. The basic structure of an email involves your name, the
                                    recipient’s name, Subject line and Content. Developing basic knowledge on email
                                    etiquettes and contents are particularly important these days.</p>

                                <p> Dear Jimmy,</p>
                               <p> Thanks for making it possible for me to go to the Tech Conference in Bangalore last
                                   week. As you know, it is the biggest technology conference in the country and very
                                important to our work. I learned a lot and I have made some new contacts that will be
                                good for our company. I think we should try to attend the ‘Innovation Day’ in April as
                                well. I focused on talks about robotics, as that is our most interesting area at the
                                moment. The presentations on robot ‘hands’ and robots for hospitals were particularly
                                interesting for us. I am attaching a detailed report on this new research with some
                                suggestions about how we can use it. Thanks again for this opportunity. I am happy to
                                discuss the report further if you are interested.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Best regards,

                                I am writing to express my interest in applying for the scholarship that your college is giving for one student.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I have completed my graduate, BBA degree from St. Charles College, securing a percentage of 87. I am eager to do my master’s degree in MBA and I would like to apply for the scholarship to help me continue with my education.
                        </p>
                          <p>
                            I am hoping that you will consider my application and allow me to fulfill my dream of completing my MBA. I look forward to hearing from you.
