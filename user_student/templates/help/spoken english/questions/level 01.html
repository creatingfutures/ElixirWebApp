                              A question is a sentence that seeks an answer for information, collection, tests and research.
                              One of the most important tasks in speaking any language is asking questions. When you ask questions, you receive information.                                   
                            </p>
                      <p>
                        There are different types of questions in English: questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no, questions that can be answered using prior knowledge and questions that require more detailed analysis. 
                      </p>  
                      <p>One type of Questions are those with 5W and 1H. These are WHY, WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE and HOW</p>
