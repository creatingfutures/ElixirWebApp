                                    Speaking effectively is defined as speaking in such a way that the message is clearly heard and,  acted upon. There are two main elements to speaking effectively: what you say, and how you say it.

                                <p>“What you say” means the choice of words. The words that will be used when chatting to a friend are likely to be different from those used in a formal presentation or interview.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similarly, the way that you speak will also vary in different situations. However, there are also some common factors: for example, whether you naturally talk quietly or loudly, and how you use body language.
