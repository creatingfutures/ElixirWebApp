                                <p>
                                    In life as much as in work, it’s important to know how to provide feedback to others, effectively and constructively without causing offence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The process of communicating with someone about something that they have done or said, with a view to changing or encouraging that behaviour is called ‘giving feedback’. And when we do give feedback, you want your feedback to be effective.
                                </p>
                                <h3 class="bg-white boxspace fonth2">What is Effective Feedback?</h3>
                                <p>Effective feedback is that which is clearly heard, understood and accepted.</p>
                                <ul class="list space" style="list-style: decimal;">
                                    <li>
                                        Feedback should be about behaviour not personality   
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Feedback should describe the effect of the person’s behaviour on you
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Feedback should be as specific as possible
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Feedback should be as specific as possible
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Pick your moment  
                                    </li>

                                <h3 class="bg-white boxspace fonth2">Receiving Feedback</h3>
                                <p>It’s also important to think about what skills you need to receive feedback, especially when it is something you don’t want to hear, and also because not everyone is skilled at giving feedback.</p>
