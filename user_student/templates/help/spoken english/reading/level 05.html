                                    Whether you're travelling to the islands or the mountains of Thailand, you're likely
                                    to spend at least one night in its capital city on the way. Bangkok might be noisy
                                    and polluted but it's also an exciting city with plenty of things to see and do. Why
                                    not make it a longer stay? Bangkok's traffic can be a nightmare. Sure, you can
                                    easily take a taxi – if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams – but there
                                    are two much better ways to get around the city. To explore the temples and
                                    historical sites, catch an express boat river taxi or a longtail boat along the Chao
                                    Phraya river and the canals. For the modern part of the city, the Skytrain is a
                                    fast, cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of
                                    Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak street market.
