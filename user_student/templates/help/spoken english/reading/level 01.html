                              Reading is one of the modules within spoken English to understand the written letters, punctuation and spaces.</p>
                      <p>
                        Reading is one of the 4 language skills, which are: 1. Listening 2. Speaking 3. Reading 4. Writing

                      <p>
                          
                        When your reading skills improve, your listening, speaking and writing skills also improve. When we read, the visual information we see is converted by our brain into words, sentences and paragraphs. 

                      </p>
                        <p>All these parts of speech have their own roles in the formation of sentences. </p>
