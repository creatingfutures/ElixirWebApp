                                    give you an understanding about the phonics by reading complex words. You are

                                <p>Long ago in a small, far away village, there was a place known as the house of 1000
                                    Mirrors. A small, happy little Dog learned of this place and decided to visit the
                                    house. When he arrived, he bounced happily up the stairs to the Doorway of the
                                    house. It looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail wagging.
                                    To his great surprise, he found himself staring at 1000 other happy little dogs with
                                    their tails wagging, just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered
                                    with 1000 great smiles just as warm and friendly. As he left the house, he thought
                                    to himself, “ This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit it often.”</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                    In the same village, another little dog, who was not quite as happy as the first
                                    one, decided to visit the stairs and hung his head low as he looked into the door.
                                    When he saw 1000 unfriendly looking dogs staring back at him, he growled at them and
                                    was horrified to see 1000 little dogs growing back at him. As he left, he thought to
                                    himself. “ That is a horrible place, and I will never go back there again.”
