                              An adverb is a word that is used to change, modify or qualify several types of words including an adjective, a verb, a clause, another adverb, or any other type of word or phrase. <br> 
                              A good way to understand adverbs is to think about them as the words that provide context. Specifically, adverbs provide a description of how, where, when, in what manner and to  <br> what extent something is done or happens. Normally, we can spot an adverb by that it often ends in –ly, but there are lots of adverbs that don’t end in this way. </p>

                            A preposition is a word used to link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence. <br> They act to connect the people, objects, time and locations of a sentence.  Prepositions are usually short words, and they are normally placed directly in front of nouns.
