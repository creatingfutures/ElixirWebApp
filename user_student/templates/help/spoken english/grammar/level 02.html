                                Verbs are the action words in a sentence that describe what the subject is doing. Along with 
                            nouns, verbs are the main part of a sentence or phrase, telling a story about what is taking place.</p>
                            <p>The action words are shout, jump, run, and eat. They tell us what’s happening in the sentence.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are three types of verbs:
                          <ul class="list">
                            <li>Action verbs (which can be transitive or intransitive) 
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  These are the ones that are used to talk 
                                  about the different actions that are happening and the physical activities that a subject might perform. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Example - taste – This apple tastes good. hear – I can hear the children crying.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>	Modal verbs (sometimes called helping verbs) 
                                <ul>
                                  <li>
                                      Modal verbs help to ask for permission and when making requests. They are used to express ability, possibility, or obligation. Each one of the modal verbs can be used to express one or more of these modalities. 
                                      They can also be used to form the future tense and to make conditional sentences.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Example - Can you come home early today? It could rain tomorrow
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>

                                <li>
                                  Auxiliary (or Helping) verbs are used together with a main verb to show the verb’s
                                       tense or to form a negative or question. The most common auxiliary verbs are have, be, and do.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      Example - She was baking a cake for dessert. Dad has been working hard all day
                                    </li>
