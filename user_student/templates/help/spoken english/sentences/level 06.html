                                    Complex sentences is also known as multi-clause sentences. A complex sentence is formed when you join a main clause and a subordinate clause with a connective. A subordinate clause is one that relies on a main clause to make sense.</p>
                                    <p>The connectives in complex sentences are conjunctions and they tell us about the order or the place in which things happened or specify a cause or effect relationship between events. </p>
                          <p>Connectives used in complex sentences include after, although, as, because, if, since, unless, when.</p>
