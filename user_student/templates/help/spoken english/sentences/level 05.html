                                <p>These are two sentences that has not separated with an end punctuation mark, or has not joined with a conjunction. I went to Paris in the vacation it is the most beautiful place I have ever visited.</p>
                                <h3>Examples</h3>
                                <ul class="space list">
                                  <li>	It's never too late to learn to swim. You never know when you may fall from a boat.</li>

                                It is helpful to read your written work aloud. When you speak, you will make natural pauses to mark the end of your sentences or clauses. If there is no corresponding end punctuation mark in your writing, <br> you can be almost certain that you have written a run-on sentence.
                                

                            </p>

                            <p>All sentences are about something or someone. The something or someone that the sentence is about is called the <b> subject </b> of the sentence. <br>    In the following sentences the subjects are shown in red. </p>
                                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                          <ul class="space list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The <b> predicate </b>contains information about the someone or something that is the subject. The example sentences above are shown again, this time with the predicate marked in green.
