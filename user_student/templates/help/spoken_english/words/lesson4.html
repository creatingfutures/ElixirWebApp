                    <p>There are several different types of noun, as follows:</p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Common noun</h4>
                    <p>A common noun is a noun that refers to people or things in general, e.g. boy, country, bridge,
                        city, birth, day, happiness.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Proper noun</h4>
                    <p>A proper noun is a name that identifies a particular person, place, or thing, e.g. Steven,
                        Africa, London, Monday. In written English, proper nouns begin with capital letters.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Concrete noun</h4>
                    <p>A concrete noun is a noun which refers to people and to things that exist physically and can be
                        seen, touched, smelled, heard, or tasted. Examples include dog, building, coffee, tree, rain,
                        beach, and shirt.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Abstract noun
                    </h4>
                    <p>An abstract noun is a noun which refers to ideas, qualities, and conditions - things that cannot
                        be seen or touched and things which have no physical reality, e.g. truth, danger, happiness,
                        time, friendship, humour.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Collective nouns</h4>
                    <p>Collective nouns refer to groups of people or things, e.g. audience, family, government, team,
                        students.
                    </p>
