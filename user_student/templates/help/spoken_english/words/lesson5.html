                    <h3 class="opacity"><b>Types of Verbs</b></h3>
                    <p>Verbs are action words, like shout, jump, run, and eat. They tell us what’s happening in the
                        sentence.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are three types of verbs:</p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Action verbs (which can be transitive or intransitive)</h4>
                    <p>These are the ones that are used to talk about the different actions that are happening and the
                        physical activities that a subject might perform. </p>
                    <p>Example -
                    <ul>
                        <li>taste – This apple tastes good.</li>
                        <li>hear – I can hear the children crying.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity"> Modal verbs (sometimes called helping verbs)</h4>
                    <p>Modal verbs help to ask for permission and when making requests. They are used to express
                        ability, possibility, or obligation. Each one of the modal verbs can be used to express one or
                        more of these modalities. They can also be used to form the future tense and to make conditional
                        sentences.</p>
                    <p> Example -
                    <ul>
                        <li> Can you come home early today?</li>
                        <li> It could rain tomorrow</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="opacity">Auxiliary verbs (sometimes called linking verbs)</h4>
                    <p>Auxiliary (or Helping) verbs are used together with a main verb to show the verb’s tense or to
                        form a negative or question. The most common auxiliary verbs are have, be, and do.</p>
                    <p>Example -
                    <ul>
                        <li>She was baking a cake for dessert.</li>
                        <li> Dad has been working hard all day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
